Purify: The Flow Within – Wave Survival Edition
New Concept:
A wave-based survival game where the player must hold out in a single arena room against endless waves of progressively stronger enemies. Inspired by the combat intensity and challenge of Dark Souls, but focused on staying alive as long as possible to purify the corrupted zone.

1. Game Start:
The game opens with a title screen and a “Start” button.

Player begins in a central arena with basic stats.

On-screen UI: HP bar, XP (Purity Points) bar, Wave counter, and zone purity meter showing progress toward full purification.

2. Player Actions:
Player can move, jump, dash, and attack.

Between waves, player can spend XP to upgrade stats or abilities.

Game responds dynamically: damage enemies, collect XP from defeated foes, and trigger wave completion once all enemies are defeated.

3. Game Logic:
The game continuously checks:

If player or enemies take damage

If the player dies → respawn at wave 1 or last checkpoint with XP penalty

If a wave is cleared → short break to upgrade, then next wave starts automatically

Defeating enemies grants XP (Purity Points).

Enemies become tougher with each wave (higher HP, new attack patterns, bosses every few waves).

4. Score & Feedback:
Score = Total XP (Purity Points) earned by surviving waves.

Visual feedback: flashes and splashes on hits, glow when leveling up.

Audio feedback: satisfying hit sounds, wave-cleared fanfare, and upgrade chimes.

5. Win/Lose Conditions:
Win: Purify the arena by surviving a set number of waves or endure endless waves for a high score (depending on game mode).

Ending scene shows a message about clean water and environmental awareness.

Lose: Player dies → restart at the last checkpoint or from wave 1, with a slight XP penalty.

6. Reset/Replay:
Player can restart the entire game or replay from a selected checkpoint.

Replay options include harder enemy variants and optional survival challenges.
